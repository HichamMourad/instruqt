title: Automating Windows environments
teaser: 10 Use cases for Windows automation
description: |-
  Most organizations use varied IT stacks within their business. You may have a Linux® server farm and use a Microsoft Active Directory
  cluster to provide identity services. Or you may maintain a cross-platform environment that builds software for multiple targets.

  Manually managing each of the different components can be tedious and error-prone.
  Automate your multivendor environments more easily with Red Hat® Ansible® Automation Platform. Through native Microsoft Windows
  support, you can now manage your Linux systems like Linux and your Windows systems like Windows, using the same automation tools.

  This track reviews 10 ways you can automate Windows systems using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

  title: Connect using WinRM
  teaser: WinRM usage in Ansible inventory file
  assignment: "An inventory file has already been created for the Windows 2016 host
    that we will be working with. However, the inventory file is missing a few key
    parameters needed to connect and automate against a Windows target.\n\n**Optional:**
    Before correcting the inventory, try running an adhoc command on the one host,
    `winhost`. Ensure you pick a module that works on Windows targets. \n\nThe default
    connection protocol when adding hosts to an inventory file is `ssh`. When automating
    Windows targets, the preferred connection protocol is `WinRM`. Therefore, we'll
    have to override the default connection protocol."

      # Your first challenge! Get Ansible to talk to Windows hosts

      WinRM is Microsoft’s built-in HTTP-based remote management technology.
      WinRM’s non-interactive login makes it difficult to perform some tasks like
      accessing the data protection application programming interface (API),
      double-hop authentication, and Windows updates. With Red Hat Ansible
      Automation Platform, you can codify authentication to automate these
      remote management tasks in Windows.

  assignment: |-
    Powershell is the task-based command-line shell and scripting language
    included with Windows. It is built on .NET and provides access to the Desired
    State Configuration (DSC) platform for configuring, deploying, and managing
    systems. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform allows you to automate brand
    new Windows systems, including all .NET and DSC functions, without installing
    another scripting language.

  assignment: |-
    Windows does not include an integrated package management system and uses
    Microsoft Store for application distribution and maintenance. However, Microsoft
    Store is not easy to automate. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform provides a
    module for automating basic package management in Windows. It also integrates
    with Chocolatey software management automation for Windows to provide automated idempotent package management.

  title: Tasks that require reboots
  teaser: Reboots... Has this ever happened to you?
  assignment: |-
    Many standard IT functions require or result in reboots in Windows. Reboots
    can be problematic when automating tasks, as a particular system effectively
    disappears during a reboot, interrupting the automation tasks. Red Hat Ansible
    Automation Platform provides a way to manage systems through reboot cycles
    to ensure that all automation tasks are performed, regardless of how many
    reboots are required.

  title: Windows Update
  teaser: Automate updates on your time
  assignment: |-
    Update management is an ongoing responsibility for all
    IT teams. Windows Update delivers software updates for
    Windows systems, and many IT teams use Microsoft System
    Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to manage these
    updates across their systems. However, SCCM can be unreliable for performing automated updates, particularly when
    reboots are involved, making it more difficult to meet maintenance windows. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform lets you
    perform basic synchronous updates using Windows Update,
    making automated updates more reliable.

  teaser: Manage key-value pairs the idempotent way
  assignment: |-
    Windows Registry stores low-level settings for the Windows
    operating system and applications. Changing registry values
    manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. Red Hat
    Ansible Automation Platform includes built-in capabilities for
    managing individual key value pairs in an idempotent fashion.
    You can also create registry templates and automatically apply
    those templates to groups of Windows systems.

    Windows SCM provides management for all Windows services,

  title: Domains
  teaser: You can't survive without them; automate them!
  assignment: |-
    Windows uses domains to manage enterprise identity.
    All systems in your enterprise environment should be joined
    to a domain. This can make testing new software, updates,
    and configurations difficult, as all test systems must be added
    to a domain. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform allows you
    to automate basic domain and domain user management to
    simplify operations. It also eases testing of new setups using
    ephemeral machines. You can automatically create throwaway
    domains, add ephemeral systems, perform your tests, and tear
    everything down quickly

  title: Access control lists (ACLs)
  teaser: Defining human readable access controls
  assignment: |-
    Security is a constant concern for IT teams. Windows uses
    ACLs to specify access rights for users, groups, and tasks.
    Configuring ACLs correctly is critical to protecting your business. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform makes it easier
    to configure and understand your ACLs. You can use clear,
    human-readable code to set up users and groups, assign rights,
    and define inheritance behaviors.
